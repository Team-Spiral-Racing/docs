# Introduction to YouTube
YouTube is the primary format of sharing content. The videos mostly contain Raw Footage videos, though there are plans to expand that eventually. Videos on the [Team Spiral Racing](https://www.youtube.com/@TeamSpiralRacing) YouTube Channel are ideally in 4K format with a minumum of 1080p.
