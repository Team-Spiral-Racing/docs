# Team Spiral Racing Website
The Team Spiral Racing website is a [SvelteKit](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/introduction) application similar to Next.js or Django. It connects to the database through a [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) ORM and authentication is handled within the backend directly.

## Code Setup
The source code is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/jonathanlo411/TeamSpiralRacing) under the GitHub user [jonathanlo411](https://github.com/jonathanlo411). The reason it is deployed here instead of the Team Spiral Racing [GitHub org](https://github.com/Team-Spiral-Racing) is due to free tier restraints limited to a single account for Vercel.

## Deployment
Deployment, as mentioned before, is handled by Vercel. There is a GitHub intergation where Vercel will pull the source code and build and deploy on its own services. The location of these services are based San Fransisco to maintain minum latency to the target audience of Team Spiral Racing
