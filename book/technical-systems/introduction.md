# Introduction to Technical Systems
This page contains information about how the technical systems are set up for Team Spiral Racing. This includes things like website, deployments, and DNS.

## Architecture
The website has a somewhat micro-service based architecture with CRON jobs pulling information from various sorces. The core of the TSR technical system is the [TSR Website](/technical-systems/tsr-web).
