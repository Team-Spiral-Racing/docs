# Logos
This section contains information on how to modify the logos as well as listing the existing logos used.

## Modifiying Logos
Logos and all branding material are designed in Figma. In order to work with/modify the logos, you will need to navigate to the Figma page named "[Team Spiral](https://www.figma.com/design/iAp4UhnW6nX7oCYaE2E8x9/Team-Spiral?node-id=0-1&t=SiYKF7tbFEEcrewQ-1)".

In order to recreate the logo text, select a textbox and write out text. Change the font to "Impact". Apply a linear gradiant fill from top to bottom. At the bottom, use `#D16163` and at the top use `#A35A84`. Finally align and skew using the "SkewDat" Figma pluggin. You will skew it by -10 deg on the x-axis.
